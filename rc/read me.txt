The files in this zipped folder are used on the Campaign_DesignForm VF Page.
We needed to break out the css and js into cachable files to improve load
time and prevent bandwidth overages for high use clients.

Each file we use has 2 versions, a full version and a minified version.
The Campaign_DesignForm VF Page uses the minified versions but for ease
of use, the non-minified version should be the one that's edited/changed.
Once the non-minified version has been edited/changed, you will need to
minify it using one of these websites and paste the minified code into
the corresponding .min.js or .min.css file.

TODO - REPLACE CURRENT VALIDATION FRAMEWORK WITH AN OPEN SOURCE ONE
The current design form code uses the following validation framework:
https://github.com/nghuuphuoc/bootstrapvalidator
Unfortunately this framework was "productized" and hasn't been updated in over 2 years.
The productized version is here and cost $200 - http://formvalidation.io/license/

To complete TAOS-1730, the bootstrapValidator.js file was downloaded, modified and
added to the static resource zip used by the design form since we needed a quick turnaround
for the bug. Long term, we should either switch to a free and maintained open source
javascript validation library such as https://jqueryvalidation.org OR buy the productized
version of the library we're currently using so we have documentation and can get updates.
