The files in this zipped folder are used on the Campaign_DesignForm VF Page.
We needed to break out the css and js into cachable files to improve load
time and prevent bandwidth overages for high use clients.

Each file we use has 2 versions, a full version and a minified version.
The Campaign_DesignForm VF Page uses the minified versions but for ease
of use, the non-minified version should be the one that's edited/changed.
Once the non-minified version has been edited/changed, you will need to
minify it using one of these websites and paste the minified code into
the corresponding .min.js or .min.css file.
